🔍Welcome to the IMDb Movie Review Scraper project! 🌟 This Python script is designed to scrape movie reviews from IMDb, providing valuable data for analysis and research purposes. The IMDb Movie Review Scraping project aims to gather a new dataset by automatically extracting movie reviews from IMDb. This dataset will support various natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis and recommendation systems. Using web scraping techniques, such as Beautiful Soup, movie reviews are collected, preprocessed, and structured into a CSV format suitable for analysis, including Support Vector Machine classification. 📈
## Features

**`Semi-supervised-sequence-learning-Project`** : replication process is done over here and for further analysis creation of new data is required.

1. Scraping Movie Reviews 🕵️‍♂️
- `Movie_review_imdb_scrapping.ipynb` - The script fetches user reviews from IMDb, providing access to a diverse range of opinions and feedback for different movies. It utilizes BeautifulSoup, a powerful Python library for web scraping, to extract data from IMDb's web pages efficiently and accurately. 🎥🔎

2. Customizable Scraper 🛠️
- `rename_files.ipynb` - Users can customize the scraper to target specific time periods, ratings, and other parameters, enabling focused data collection based on their requirements. This flexibility allows researchers, analysts, and enthusiasts to tailor the scraping process to their specific needs. 🎯🔧

3. CSV Output 📁
- `convert_texts_to_csv.ipynb` - The scraped data is saved into a CSV file, allowing for easy import into data analysis software or further processing. The CSV format ensures compatibility with a wide range of tools and platforms, making it convenient to incorporate the scraped data into various workflows and projects. 💾💼
