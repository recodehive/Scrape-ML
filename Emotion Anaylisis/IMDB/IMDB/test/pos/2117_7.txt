['"The Big Short" is a good film but also a film that would be tough for the average viewer to enjoy and understand. This is because although the housing bubble\'s burst was a mess and destroyed a lot of peoples\' lives, few folks really understand it. Sure, folks know that the banks were foolish as were home buyers (since they couldn\'t possibly afford these homes)....but that\'s about as far as their understanding goes. And, with the film tossing around all sorts of insider jargon, it\'s sure to confuse more than entertain.What I would LOVE to see is a pop-up video version of the film with explanatory text appearing on the screen throughout the movie to further clarify what is happening. I\'ve seen several Japanese import films like this--and they helped to explain cultural references that most non-Japanese viewers would miss.The bottom line is that I am extremely well educated compared to the average person and yet I sometimes felt a bit lost. Enjoyable but best watched with an economics professor sitting in the room to explain it all in detail.']
