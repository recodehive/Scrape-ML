["The Hangover is about a group of 4 guys going to Las Vegas for a bachelor party just two days before the wedding.Though bachelor party films are so overdone, The Hangover puts a fresh spin on the whole concept. The delivery of the plot is refreshing, I like the way they have to find out what happened the night before as they wake up from their eventful night. It's so refreshing to see them trying to figure out what they did, and to see the shock of what they really did! The jokes are phenomenally funny, it's out of the world. Basically the film is unbelievably funny, you have to see it to believe it."]
