["You'll never be mean? I actually have no idea, but if you find something to rhyme this with, be my guest and use it! While I'm not sure about the 3-D in the movie, I do know that I liked the movie overall. Despite its flaws and faults. The female lead seems to have too little to do and the family subplot seems almost irrelevant. But you never know (unless it's in the comics, which I only read a few when I was a kid), if some of those things might get interesting in the inevitable sequel.The effects are pretty good and our main guy is likable. There is the funny/goofy friend and other things (like our hero's arch) and the actors obviously have fun with it all. Captain America was way better though and might have gotten bad reviews because people were starting to get fed up with comic book movies (which might be partly Green Lanterns fault).One other thing: After the credits start to roll, stay put. A couple of minutes into the credits there is a tag scene ... that's all I'm going to say ... well that and the fact that after that, when the credits start to roll again, this movie is over."]
