['Sergio Leone\'s second installment in his spaghetti-western trilogy with lead actor Clint Eastwood (following 1964\'s "A Fistful of Dollars" and in turn followed by 1966\'s "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"). Bounty hunter Clint spars with gunslinger Lee Van Cleef amidst a great many dirt-town and saloon shoot-outs. Sweaty atmospherics, some exciting sequences (including a terrific finish), but Leone\'s pacing is unbelievably dogged. Although the films in this canon have a tricky kind of symbolism which underline the finished product with a bracing, immediate quality that can be quite gripping for an audience, they are not deep-thinkers, and after the first hour it becomes blurry with noisy violence. *1/2 from ****']
