['The first 80-90% of "Interstellar" I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn\'t make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It\'s sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful "Gravity", it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it\'s a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.']
