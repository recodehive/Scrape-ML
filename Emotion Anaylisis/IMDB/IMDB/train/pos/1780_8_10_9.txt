["This is the story of a Japan so out of control that in order to regain control (I think) they stage a survival game that makes TV's Survivor look like a walk in the park. One class of kids is dumped on an island and told that the last one alive wins. This is a very very funny movie in a black comedy sort of way. Its very violent and bloody and makes you wonder about why you're laughing since its not all that far off from the way society operates, especially Japanese society, where kids regularly kill themselves for not getting into the right school.Its not for all tastes. Some people will find the idea offensive, a fact that has kept the film from having an official US release. If you can take your comedy black as night, then see this movie.8 out of 10"]
