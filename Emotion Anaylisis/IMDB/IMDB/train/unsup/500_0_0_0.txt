['I don\'t really have anything to say; read George Orwell\'s essay on "No Orchids for Miss Blandish" and discover why it\'s all been said before, better than I could say it.Obviously the show is cruddy enough on aesthetic grounds: I don\'t know whether to blame the wooden acting or the 100%-exposition dialogue, so let\'s blame both. But people are willing to overlook such things on TV in the interests of fantasy. I am too. What\'s depressing is that people are willing to overlook the lousiness of the production in the interests of what they\'re really getting out of the show: the chance to watch the hounds chase the fox for an hour, until the latter collapses of exhaustion.What\'s also depressing is that this show is part of a trend. In the past, a leading-up-to-the-trial kind of TV show would have focused on the defence lawyers; it\'s a shame that we\'re now getting a kick out of siding with the prosecution, especially when it\'s this bunch of deeply unpleasant people.Perry Mason didn\'t have a mean streak.']
