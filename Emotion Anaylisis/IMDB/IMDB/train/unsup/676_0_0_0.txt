['It all started with "The Flintstones," I suppose. In its time, it was novel. Since then we\'ve had a number of versions of the dumb dad cartoon. This one was recommended to me by a reader because it is edgier than the others.Here\'s the formula we have to all these: "Simpsons," "South Park," this.Three elements to the formula: The story which involves some hairbrained situation which has an old fashioned moral. No matter how risky or gross the humor, it is "justified" by this. A carefully metered dose of "edgy" jokes about sex, religion and politics, sometimes death. Shifts from the story into self-referential alternative worlds from other TeeVee shows. This is what my friend thought I would like, mostly because it is so prominent. The notion is that these characters all know they are in movieland and that all their jokes and doings are from that world. So they move seamlessly from their town into other worlds.Seemed like tame stuff to me. That\'s because of the limits of TeeVee I suppose. See what the South Park guys did with the big screen without these limits. I\'m not impressed.Ted\'s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.']
