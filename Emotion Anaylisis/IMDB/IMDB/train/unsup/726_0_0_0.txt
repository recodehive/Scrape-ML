["I remember my school days and there is one chapter I remember we had in rapid reading section, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Blue Carbuncle. More than half a decade later, I sit here with a smacked gob on how genius people can be.Sherlock follows some of Doyle's works, but the style is extraordinary. With 3 90-minute episodes every series, it really pulls a side story to the beloved bro couple. The writing is very fresh and so in line with the quality that we have today in TV. AMC's Breaking Bad is a strong competitor here.Performances by Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman are what takes the series ahead of all other BBC productions. In fact, the whole cast is par excellence. The first season introduced to the style and here we are in the third season, with a cliffhanger. The music is very melodious and apt for the rather quirky facets of the person the show is based on.The screenplay tries hard to simplify things/dialogs/references but quite fails in some episodes; the fastidious theme aggravates both the viewing and confusion causing factors... For exempli gratia, S01E01 was a 9/10, but S01E02 was only 7/10. But, as we know British TV is much different from its counterparts, Sherlock is a winner.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended!"]
