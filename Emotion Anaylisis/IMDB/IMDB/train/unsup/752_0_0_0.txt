['Daredevil is yet another excruciatingly dull, formulaic outing from the Marvel stable. After the awful Agents of Shield and its dismal spin off Agent Carter I had hoped we had seen the last of this cheesy comic book franchise. Sadly that was not to be the case. I should have known better but I took a look at Daredevil. Really there is not a lot to say. Classic US stick about a guy with "traditional" read "conservative" values turned vigilante with a hero complex. Like almost all of its counterparts, its driven by melodramatic, often corny, exposition. Forget about meaningful character development or interesting story lines, they are conspicuous by their absence. All in all if you are not selective in your viewing and like lots of guns, fighting and mindless noise, this might appeal to you. If, on the other hand you like interesting, engaging series I\'d give this one a pass. Two out of ten from me.']
