["This is such an uncomfortable movie to watch. I understand what the Marines do. There is one lead fighting machine and they are it. I like to think that what is done is a lot more humane. I believe that one can be toughened without being dehumanized. The character of Pyle is singled out. It seems that if one wanted to terrorize a group of recruits, you don't just focus on the one weak link. This guy should have been shipped out. He was never going to make it. Some guys achieve strength through suffering. He continued to submit to the horrors of boot camp despite the over the top attacks on him. If I wanted to show a definition of sadism, I would use this movie. Now, I agree with a previous writer that in wartime, the carelessness of one man could cost the lives of others, and the sergeant was making a point. But was Pyle becoming a better soldier? Did he ever becomes a better soldier, or was his spirit broken almost from the beginning? There has to be something to be said for the endurance of this man and how long he lasts, even if he fails. The ending did not surprise me. I anticipated it."]
