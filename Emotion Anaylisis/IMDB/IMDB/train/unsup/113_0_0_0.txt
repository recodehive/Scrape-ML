["To me this story of Schindler is a split personality of a film. On one hand its stark black and white photography and realistic view of life in the ghetto and the camp is a kick in the heart. The problem is what should have been a stark gripping in your face take on the Nazi destruction of those it hated is undercut by a classic MGM 1940's style photography in every other scene. I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making this and not Spielberg. To me it has always felt that Spielberg waffled on the subject because he feared what the reaction would be.\nIts not a bad film, its just not the great one it wants to be."]
