['"Bones" is a great show, one with fine acting and interesting oddball characters. It\'s one of those detective-forensic shows that are all the rage nowadays, but you know what, it\'s all good fun. Based on the real-life experiences of a real forensic expert Kathy Reichs, Dr. Temperance "Bones" Brennan (Emily Deschanel) is the star of the show, the preeminent medical expert at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. A bit socially unskilled but every bit dedicated to her work, she and her team of equally socially unskilled oddball co-workers work together to solve murders where many times all they have are "bones" to go on. On the justice side of it, is Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz, of "Angel") of the F.B.I., who often teams up with Brennan to go after the bad guys. This is a fun show, one of those shows that you can watch over and over again and not have to really think about it too much. It\'s just pure entertainment; what more could you want?']
