["Bones has always been a formula show - find body, look at skeleton, see cause of death, track down killer. Along the way, we get a glimpse into some unique social sub-culture, giving Brennan the opportunity to play cultural anthropologist and explain human behavior to Booth in her own twistedly uber-scientific way. Yet, even after 80+ episodes I find myself NOT tiring of the formula, thanks to the great chemistry between the leads, plus the likable gang of supporting characters - Hodgins, Sweets, etc. - and the continuing high production values and well thought out mysteries. Plus one of the greatly appealing aspects of the show - the idea that we are eavesdropping on people working at the very cutting edge of forensic technology - also has not gotten old. Nor has the will they, won't they nature of the relationship between the two principals. Normally one of these slow burn Remington Steele romances has a best before period of about three seasons, after which the viewer loses interest over things apparently not going anywhere. Here, though, the unique nature of the Brennan character makes the slow approach logical and necessary. The show is still operating at the high level of quality, interest and creativity that initially made it a hit and fans of the show will not be disappointed by the latest season."]
