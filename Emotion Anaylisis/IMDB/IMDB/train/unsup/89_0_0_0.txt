['Okay, so maybe "Back to the Future" seems a little hokey, but it\'s so cool! You probably know the story: typical \'80s teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back to 1955. His existence is threatened when his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) falls for him instead of his father George (Crispin Glover). Only the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) can help him. Along the way he has to cope with local bully Biff Tannen.If the movie is excessively nostalgic, then they play it to good effect. I sometimes have to wonder what would happen if I accidentally went back in time and met my parents. Given what happens in this movie, it\'s probably best that I stay in my own time.Anyway, it\'s an interesting contrast/comparison between the \'50s and \'80s. After all, who in the \'50s would have imagined Reagan becoming president, or any town having an African-American mayor? So check this movie out; it won\'t disappoint you.']
