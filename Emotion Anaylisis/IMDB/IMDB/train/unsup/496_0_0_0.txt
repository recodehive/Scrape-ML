["Bryan Cranston shows his acting skills portraying the complex character of Walter White. He's a long suffering high school chemistry teacher who suddenly finds he's dying of cancer. With little prospect of leaving anything to his family, he teams up with a former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make meth. They're so good at it that they become major criminals.This is the best of television which can be found on cable. Walter White is a complex character that actually grows over the life of the show. He is a good character that we root for at the beginning even thought he's become a criminal. The journey he makes is one worthy of great literature. It is absolutely must see TV."]
